Even the sharing of records between providers in the same city can come with long delays and major hassles for patients. With UniRep, a user's medical records could be attested to them by each provider at the time of service. When a provider required access to a record, the user would prove with zk that the requested data is theirs. The user would always be in control of their own records, and any stored medical data would be anonymous. In this case each provider would be an attester in an interoperable multi-attester system.
